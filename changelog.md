  * all KD-OrbitalPad.dds
* Added thermal properties to KD-Pad and KD-OrbitalPad to prevent overheating-explosions during vessel-launch (might be exploitable ...).
* Added thermal curves to KD-Furnace and KD-3D-Printer.
* The Furnace needs to heat up before Metal can be extracted. CoreTemperature must at least reach 1800 K to start the extraction! Heating needs a lot of ElectricCharge. Once the extraction has started the heater can be turned off.
* The 3D-Printer needs 20 ElectricCharge instead of 10. It needs RoomTemperature to operate (300 K). Heat production is rather low.
* Some minor model and texture changes.
* Added 512x512 textures to Customisation.
* Added "KD-Example Craft.craft" to Customisation.
* Updated CTT-compatibility.
